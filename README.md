<h2><b>Volunteering</b></h2>
<body>Yes, volunteering because serving the community you work and live in is vital for personal and societal growth. Whether I'm volunteering for an animal shelter, helping a marketing team, setting up for the PTA or helping out at a city wide event, I am intrigued at the idea of helping others.</body>
