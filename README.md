<h2><b>Volunteering</b></h2>
<body>Yes, volunteering because serving the community you work and live in is vital for personal and societal growth. Whether I'm volunteering for an animal shelter, helping a marketing team, setting up for the PTA or helping out at a city wide event, I am intrigued at the idea of helping others. Along side my volunteering activities I enjoy learning. Through my hybrid education at The University of Houston and online at princeton, and Google I have acquired unique Key Skills for interacting with people and sharing my expertise. Key Skills are an alias for my Soft skills because we need knowledge, kindness and compassion to grow as individuals and in our proffessional careers.</body>
